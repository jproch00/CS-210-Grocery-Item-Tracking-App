This project is my final project from my CS 210 class at SNHU.
The basis of the project was to build an item-tracking program for a grocery store.
The grocery store, Corner Grocer, tracks purchased items in chronological order within a txt file.
The purpose of the project is to help Corner Grocer rearrange their produce section so that they can create an efficient layout for their customers.
The program reads the txt file, and depending on the user input - allows the user to lookup the frequency of a specific item, outputs the frequency of each item, or prints a histogram.
In addition to this, the program creates a backup file to ensure that the data is accessible if the original file is lost.
For my information, take a look at "CS210 Project Three Documentation.docx"
